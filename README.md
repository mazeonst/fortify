About Fortify Pass
Fortify Pass is a desktop application designed to generate strong passwords with various customizable options. It offers the following features:

Generate multiple passwords at once.
Generate passwords of user-defined length.
Integrate custom phrases or words into the password.
Options for password generation include:
Adding numbers to the password.
Adding special characters to the password.
Choice of generating characters of different cases.
Fortify Pass can also encrypt passwords using the "cryptography.fernet" library.

Upon launching the program, the encryption key is automatically loaded into the "encryption_key.key" file.

ATTENTION! IT IS IMPORTANT TO STORE THE ENCRYPTION KEY IN A SEPARATE LOCATION, OTHERWISE THERE IS A RISK OF LOSING ALL ENCRYPTED DATA!

In the "password and data" window, there is a "encrypt" button. After clicking it, the password is encrypted and saved to the "passwords.txt" file.

On the main screen of the program, there is a "Decrypt" button. After clicking it, the "Decrypt Password" window opens, where you can decrypt the data thanks to the previously saved encryption key.
